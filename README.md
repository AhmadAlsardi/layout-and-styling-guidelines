Key Changes:
Indentation: All nested blocks of code are properly indented with 4 spaces per level.

Whitespace: I've added blank lines between logical sections of the code (e.g., between method definitions and logical blocks).

Line Length: I broke down longer lines into shorter ones to avoid exceeding the 80-character limit, especially for method calls and conditions.

Consistent Formatting: I made sure the curly braces { are on the same line for method definitions and control structures for consistency.

Clarity in Expressions: Complex conditions and loops are clearly separated into multiple lines where appropriate.

Comments: Comments are clear and concise, with blank lines separating them from the code they describe.

This reformatted code should now be much easier to read and modify. Let me know if you'd like any further tweaks!
